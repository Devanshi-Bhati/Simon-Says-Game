# Simon-Says-Game
This is my Web development project.
Simon Says is a classic game that's great for testing memory and reflexes. Here's how it works:

A leader (let's call them Simon) gives commands to the other players, but only if the command is preceded by the phrase "Simon says." For example, "Simon says touch your nose."
If Simon gives a command without saying "Simon says" first, players should not follow the command. For example, if Simon says "Touch your toes" without saying "Simon says," anyone who touches their toes is out.
The last player remaining wins and becomes the next Simon.
